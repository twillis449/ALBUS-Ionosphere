Please watch the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO5TYy396xU for detailed instructions on how to use the data analysis scripts. Hopefully, it will not put you to sleep! More detailed written instructions may follow.<br><br>external python packages needed<br>numpy, matplotlib, scikit-image, astropy, scipy, shapely , json,<br>cosmocalc (at https://cxc.harvard.edu/contrib/cosmocalc/)<br><br>Installation: Put the python code in some directory that&apos;s in your PYTHONPATH, make the scripts executable, and hopefully things will work for you. The code has been tested with python 3.8 on Ubuntu 20.04<br><br>There are two main scripts in the package - get_morphology_images.py and get_galaxy_parameters.py.<br><br>Get_morphology_images uses morphological erosion and dilation to remove background sources from a radio astronomy image. It extends the technique described in Rudnick, 2002 https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/342499/pdf.<br><br>The process can be described through the following equations:<br><br>o = original image<br>d - output from erosion/dilation<br>t = white TopHat, which should show only compact structures smaller than the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; structure element<br>t = o - d &nbsp;<br>m = mask derived from a comparison where &nbsp;t &gt; some signal<br>m * t = m * (o - d)<br>o_d = output diffuse image<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; = o - m * t &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; = o - (m * o - m * d)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; = o - m * o + (m * d)<br><br>we don&apos;t know the flux scale of m * d as we don&apos;t know the flux scale of the<br>dilated image, but it is buried in the output image, so get rid of it<br>by subtracting it off, which equates to<br><br>o_d &nbsp;= o - m * o<br>and<br>o_c = image of compact objects<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; = m * o &nbsp;<br><br>Get_galaxy_parameters integrates the signal contained within specified polygon areas of a radio astronomy image to derive integrated flux densities and other parameters of a radio source.<br><br><br></p>
