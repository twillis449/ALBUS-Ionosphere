# Note: if you look at the position of the nuclear source in the 
# 3C236_Final-dilated.fits image there is only a maximum residual  of ~ 5mJy 
# whereas the original peak is ~ 5 Jy so we have a residual of only 
# ~0.1 percent! 

# also look at 3C236_final_minus-filtered_dilated_all.fits. This show the result
# of 'blindly' subtracting the filtered data contained within all polygons above
# the minimum allowable signal. Sometimes thats OK if the source of interest is 
# faint emission below the specified flux limit, but here we start removing 
# signal from the actual 3C236 lobes, which is NOT what we want.
